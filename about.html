<p>
  I'm a passionate Senior Java Developer with over 4 years of experience in designing and building scalable, high-performance enterprise applications.
  I specialize in full-stack development using Java, Spring Boot, Angular, React, and AWS.
  My work spans across diverse industries, solving complex technical challenges with clean, efficient code.

  With strong exposure to microservices architecture, cloud-native deployments, and CI/CD pipelines, I love working in agile teams and pushing the limits of what technology can do.
